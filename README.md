## Overview of how this app works and why it was built

This app was built to log which burgers have been eaten. It allows the users to keep track of their burger intake.

## How the app is organized

The app is a simple one page app that uses MYSQL, Node to query a database and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## How to use this app

1) Users can add a Burger name

2) Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
 
3) Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

## Technologies used in the App

This app was built using Html, CSS, javascript, mySQL, Node, Express and Handlebars

It is deployed on heroku and able to capture and log which burgers have been eaten.
